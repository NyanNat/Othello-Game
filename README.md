# TWO-PLAYER OTHELLO GAME

![alt text](https://github.com/NyanNat/Othello-Game/blob/master/othello-starting.PNG)

This is my attempt of making a two-player Othello/Reversi game using JavaScript.

<br />
How to play:
<br />
1.  Decide between yourselves, which side are each of you going to represent (black/white).<br />
2.  After every players are ready, press the start button. The black side will start first.<br />
3.  All the viable placing position in the board for each turn will be highlighted in yellow. Click on one of the yellow box to place the your piece.<br />
4.  Play until the board is full, the side with more pieces on the board at the end of the game will be the winner.<br />
